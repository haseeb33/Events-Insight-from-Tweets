The main goal of this project is events extraction from twitter data. Not only event's names but also insights(people's interest, event duration, before and after effects) about these events. Finally this information is visualized graphically along with top words of topic(provides the information about event), top hashtags(Context), Burst information(Twitter user's interest in this topic).
